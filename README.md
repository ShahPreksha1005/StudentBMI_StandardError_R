# Student BMI Standard Error Calculation

**Author**: Preksha Shah  

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing student height and weight to calculate statistical measures, including standard error, correlation, and frequency distribution. The analysis is conducted in R, using a CSV file created specifically for this exercise.

## Objectives
- Import student BMI data in R from a CSV file
- Calculate the standard error for height and weight
- Explore the correlation between height and weight
- Perform frequency distribution analysis on the data

## Files
- `L1.csv`: Contains the student data on height, weight, and UG qualification.
- `analysis_code.R`: Script with R code for data loading, standard error calculation, correlation, and frequency distribution.

## Analysis
- **Data Import**: Reads data from a CSV file.
- **Standard Error Calculation**: Computes standard error for both height and weight across multiple samples.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examines the relationship between height and weight.
- **Frequency Distribution**: Provides an overview of data distribution across the height and weight columns.

## Results
- Summary statistics including mean, standard deviation, and standard error for student height and weight.
- Insights into the correlation between height and weight.

## Technologies Used
- **R**: For statistical calculations and data manipulation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `analysis_code.R` in RStudio.
3. Run the script to see data import, calculations, and statistical results.
